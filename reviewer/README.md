# Reviews Challenge: jQuery and Parse

This folder contains your submission for the [reviews challenge](http://info343-joelross.rhcloud.com/challenges/reviews). The below questions should be answered with details about your submission!

##### 1. Who did you pair with to test your application? #####
I turned my assignment in very late so I couldnt pair with anyone properly, however I did have Brookes Lobey from my section test my website, but I didnt test his until after he turned it in. Which hopefully is the same thing.

##### 2. Did you fix or learn anything from pair-testing your program? #####
There was some sizing issues yes

##### 3. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who. #####
A few people in the TE labs I do not remember their names.

##### 4. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what? #####
no

##### 5. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
20+ hours lol

##### 6. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
Raty took a long time to get working. Over all I felt like I was teaching myself most of the material needed to build this website. I felt like I really didnt have the tools at all going into it. But now I do have those tools and I think this assignment has taught me more than any previous ones.
